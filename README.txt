Perspective Viewer

Install freegl first, F3 required OpenGL

The code was entirely derived from those sample programs.

The teapot can rotate properly.

The menu should work and it pops up when you right click.

For the teapot translation, the distance teapot moves may not be as accurate as mouse moving distance.



Project works for Virtual Studio.
I really don't know how to sepreate my files into two folders.
If something went wrong, I have another folder called F3, it has the source file and Makefile, 
the program should be able to compile if the machine has installed OpenGL.
